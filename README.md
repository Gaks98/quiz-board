# Quiz Board

# Description
Quiz Board is a web application that allows anyone to users to first fill in their credentials before accessing the JavaScript questions. The website has a count down that is set to show the dead line of the day and time the test trial will end. Before access to the test the user MUST fill both their names and email, failure to adhere to this leads to an error pop up message that alerts them on what they have done wrong. Else if they fill all the required input spaces they get a welcome pop up message that welcomes them and sends them to the next page which is the quiz page on clicking okay on the pop-up.
